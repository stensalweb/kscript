# `modules/sys` - system library

This is a general purpose library, wrapping many of the functionalities that `libc` would wrap, for instance, containing FILE I/O, stat'ing files

## Building

`sys` doesn't require any special dependencies, so it should always be enabled, and built as part of the normal build process (set `KSM_STD='sys ...' make)
