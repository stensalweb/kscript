# BUILD.md

This file contains more detailed building/installation information for kscript.

Most of this information is detailed in `./Makefile` as well

## Dependencies

Although kscript itself strives to require 0 dependencies other than a C compiler and `make`, some of the standard libraries may require external libraries to be installed (for example, the multimedia library requires some audio/image libraries).

Here are a list of standard modules (found in `./std`) and their requirements

| Module | Deps | Ubuntu Install | Homebrew Install | URL |
