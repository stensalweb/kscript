## What is EZC?

EZC is programming language meant to enable fast calculations of multiprecision floats, but with RPN syntax, and without memory management.

It is sort of like a calculator language, but with for, if, function definitions, and more advanced features.

Also, the EZC std libraries have many functions dealing with more advanced functionality than even `math.h` or most system math libraries have.

EZC supports all trigonometric functions to full precision, many obscure functions (Gamma, Zeta, Bessel, etc), as well as extensions of common functions to all real numbers, such as factorial (via Gamma function).


### Who is it for?

This programming language is for people who want a unique computing experience, and like exploring interesting ideas in PLT (Programming Language Theory).

This language isn't for everyone. It is meant to be easy, but it is not meant for GUIs, elaborate printing, writing libraries in, or anything like that. It is meant to be a calculator like language which is performant, and easy to distribute on any operating system with a C99 compiler.


## How can I use it?

Well, just follow the [quick start guide](./#/quickstart), and go along!

It is mainly terminal based, but I plan to make an IDE in the future.
